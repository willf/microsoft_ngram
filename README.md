microsoft_ngram
===============

This is a simple ruby gem to access the Bing Ngram data. It's loosely based on Microsoft's Python library.
Source code at [github.com/willf/microsoft_ngram](http://github.com/willf/microsoft_ngram).

Installation
------------

Email [webngram@microsoft.com](mailto:webngram@microsoft.com?subject=Token%20Request) and request a token.
When you get your token, add it to your .bashrc or .bash_profile:

    export NGRAM_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"
    
Then install the gem:

    gem install microsoft_ngram

Usage
-----

To get a list of currently available models:
 
    > MicrosoftNgram.models
    => ["bing-anchor/jun09/1", "bing-anchor/jun09/2", "bing-anchor/jun09/3", "bing-anchor/jun09/4", "bing-body/jun09/1", "bing-body/jun09/2", "bing-body/jun09/3", "bing-title/jun09/1", "bing-title/jun09/2", "bing-title/jun09/3", "bing-title/jun09/4", "bing-query/jun09/1", "bing-query/jun09/2", "bing-query/jun09/3"] 
 
To see the default model:

    > MicrosoftNgram.new.model            
    => "bing-body/jun09/3" 

Parameters to the initializer are:

    :model => <i>string</i> (sets model)
    :user_token => <i>string</i> (sets user token)
    :debug => <i>boolean</i> (will show GET/POST calls)
 
So, to use the 2-gram title model:

    > model = MicrosoftNgram.new(:model => "bing-title/jun09/2")

To get a single joint probability, or multiple joint probabilities (If
you know you want multiple joint probabilities, it is better to ask
for several at once):

    > MicrosoftNgram.new.jps(['fish sticks', 'frog sticks'])
    => [["fish sticks", -6.853792], ["frog sticks", -9.91852]] 
    > MicrosoftNgram.new.jp("fish sticks")
    => -6.853792 

To get a single conditional probability, or multiple conditional probabilities (If you know you want multiple conditional probabilities, it is better to ask for several at once):

    > MicrosoftNgram.new.cp("fish sticks")
    => -2.712575 
    > MicrosoftNgram.new.cps(['fish sticks', 'frog sticks'])
    => [["fish sticks", -2.712575], ["frog sticks", -4.788582]] 

To yield the most probable next token using the default model:

    > MicrosoftNgram.new.generate("Microsoft Windows",5)  {|x| puts x.join(' ')}
    xp -0.6964428
    vista -0.9242383
    server -1.106876
    2000 -1.145312
    currentversion -1.168404

To use the query model for the same thing:

    > MicrosoftNgram.new(:model => 'bing-query/jun09/3').generate("Microsoft Windows",5)  {|x| puts x.join(' ')}
    xp -0.5429792
    </s> -1.062959
    update -1.08291
    vista -1.199022
    installer -1.248958
    
Sample Script
-------------

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'microsoft_ngram'
l = []
Bing::Ngram.new(:model => "bing-body/apr10/5").generate('a bum',50){ |w,_| l << w }
l.join("; ")
```
